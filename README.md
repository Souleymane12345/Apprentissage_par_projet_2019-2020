# Apprentissage_par_projet_2019-2020

Implementation of a system allowing the automation of electronic, electrical and fluid applications within the framework of app2.

As a solution, we have created a connected house equipped with artificial intelligence.

The use of this application is based on certain compasses such as the realization of the arduino assembly comprising different sensors such as: smoke, intensity, pump, the, relays, fan, camera.

The file seri/seri.ino file contains the arduino codecontains sever.js which connects our arduino board to our web application through the serial port.

Here is the source code the more detailed readme is being written and will be available shortly.
